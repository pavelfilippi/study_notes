# Ansible
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open source infrastracture automation tool initially developed by Red Hat.

Ansible uses so called 'playbooks' (`yaml` files). Each playbook contains 'play'. Each play consists of name for the 'play', 'host' that it runs against, the actual 'task' to run. Actions you want to run multiple times can be grouped to 'roles'.
